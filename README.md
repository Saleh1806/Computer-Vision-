# Computer Vision

I am deeply interested in everything related to computer vision. This repository is my personal lab: a place where I collect and build demos that help me visualize the theoretical concepts I learn, and where I also ship my own projects.

I approach this work with curiosity and rigor. I like learning from ideas and people across the world, and I turn that learning into tangible experiments that I can see, measure, and improve. If you are looking for someone who is passionate, disciplined, and constantly growing, this repo is meant to show that I am a high‑potential candidate you should not let go.
